Boost:
- Cross-Platform Support: Boost is designed to be cross-platform compatible, making it easier to write code that can be compiled and run on multiple operating systems and architectures, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and more.
- Simplicity and Ease of Use: Boost.Asio provides a clean and intuitive API for networking that makes it relatively easy to learn and use. It abstracts the complexities of low-level networking operations, such as socket handling, TCP/IP, UDP, and asynchronous I/O, which simplifies network programming tasks.
