1. Use a specific version: Instead of using the "latest" tag for the base image, it is recommended to use a specific version, such as Ubuntu 22.04. This ensures consistency and avoids potential compatibility issues.

2. Minimize the number of layers: Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, which affects the build time and image size. Consolidate commands where possible to reduce the number of layers.

3. Use ARG for configurable parameters: By using ARG, such as CMAKE_VERSION and BOOST_VERSION, you make your Dockerfile more configurable and flexible. This allows users to specify the desired versions during the build process.

4. Clean up the build environment: After building any required dependencies, it is recommended to remove any unnecessary artifacts or temporary files to reduce the final image size.

5. Use a multi-stage build: Utilizing a multi-stage build, as seen in your Dockerfile, helps separate the build environment from the final image. This reduces the attack surface by only including necessary dependencies in the final image.

6. Create a non-root user: Creating a non-root user and setting ownership of the application files to this user enhances security, as it limits the privileges of the container.

7. Set the working directory: Using the WORKDIR instruction ensures that subsequent instructions are executed in the specified directory, providing a consistent context for the application.
