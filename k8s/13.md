The outcome varies as each pod possesses its own storage, and our access to services is facilitated by disparate pods.

There's no need for assurances of order in our application as there's no data interdependence among pods.

The `podManagementPolicy: Parallel` directive can be utilized to concurrently initiate all pods (this can be set up in `values.yaml` and within the `statefulset.yaml`)
