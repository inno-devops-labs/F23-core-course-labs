# Docker Role

1. Update Repositories Cache: This task updates the package repositories cache on all hosts using the ansible.builtin.apt module. It ensures that the system's package information is up to date.

2. Install Pip and Docker Python Package: This task installs Pip and the Python packages docker and docker-compose using the geerlingguy.pip Ansible role. It specifies the packages to be installed in the pip_install_packages variable.

3. Install Docker and Docker Compose: This section installs Docker and Docker Compose using the geerlingguy.docker Ansible role. It configures various Docker-related settings, such as package state, service state, and enabling the service. It also specifies users who should have access to Docker.

4. Copy the Docker Compose File to the Image: This part of the playbook copies a Docker Compose file from ../../app/docker_compose.yml to /app on all hosts. This is achieved with the specified role and variable settings.

5. Start the Application: This final section has two tasks:

The first task "Reset the connection to allow the user group to apply" uses the meta module to reset the SSH connection. This might be necessary to apply changes to user group permissions.
The second task uses the community.docker.docker_compose module to create and start a Docker Compose service. The project_src variable is set to /app, indicating the location of the Docker Compose file.
