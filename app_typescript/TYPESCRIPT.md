## Applied best practices

- **Project Structure**: Followed a well-structured project layout.
- **Version Control**: Used Git to track changes in the codebase.
- **Testing**: The app's functionality was validated through a combination of manual testing and the use of unit tests.
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Pre-commit hooks were implemented to automate code formatting and enforce coding standards. Prettier and linters were integrated into the development workflow to ensure consistent code quality before each commit.
- **Git submodule**: Git submodules were employed to manage external dependencies effectively.
