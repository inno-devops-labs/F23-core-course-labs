# Javascript web application

## Description
Here I developed small web application that displays the current time in Moscow.
For this application I chose Svelte framework.

## Why Svelte framework?
Svelte was chosen as a JavaScript framework for this application because it compiles components into efficient, lightweight code, resulting in fast load times and smaller bundles. 
Svelte's declarative and reactive approach simplifies code readability and maintenance while eliminating the need for runtime libraries.

## Best practices
* Reactivity: using reactive declarations (e.g., let and $:
* Linting and Formatting: Use linters and code formatters (e.g., ESLint and Prettier) to enforce code style and catch potential issues
