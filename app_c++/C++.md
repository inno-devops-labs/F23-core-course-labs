# Developing a C++ Application for Time Left Until Summer

In this document, I will provide an overview of the C++ application developed to calculate and display the time left until the start of summer.

## Best practices

1. Using Meaningful Variable and Function Names
2. Following a Consistent Coding Style
3. Avoiding Global Variables

## Project Overview

The C++ Time Left Until Summer App is a simple yet illustrative project that combines C++ and web development. Here are some key points about the project:

- **Time Calculation**: The application calculates the time remaining until the summer season starts, based on a predefined date (e.g., June 1st).
- **HTTP Server**: It utilizes the `cpp-httplib` library to create a lightweight HTTP server in C++.

## Code Structure

The core components of the project include:

- **C++ Server**: The server is implemented in C++ and serves both the HTML page and the time data through designated HTTP endpoints.
- **Time Calculation**: Time calculation logic is implemented to determine the time left until the summer season.

## Installation and Usage

To run the application locally, follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the project's [README.md](README.md) file.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the project's [README.md](README.md) file.

## Conclusion

The C++ Time Left Until Summer App is a demonstration of combining C++ and web technologies to create a application. It showcases the potential of C++ in web development when coupled with libraries like `cpp-httplib`. The project's open nature encourages collaboration and contributions from the developer community.
