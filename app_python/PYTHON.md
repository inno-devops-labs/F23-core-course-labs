# FastAPI Usage in app_python

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It's production-ready and provides several advantages, making it suitable for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Best Practices Applied:

### 1. Coding Standards:

We used the PEP 8 coding standard, which is the style guide for Python code. By adhering to this standard, our code becomes more readable and maintainable. We used the `flake8` linter to enforce these standards. It checks our code base against the PEP 8 guidelines and provides feedback on any deviations.

### 2. Type Annotations:

FastAPI uses Python type hints. These type hints not only help with the automatic generation of API documentation but also make the code more robust by offering a form of type checking.

### 3. Modular Code:

Our code is organized in a modular way, separating different functionalities into different functions and potentially different files. This ensures that our application remains scalable and easy to maintain as it grows.

### 4. Testing:

We implemented tests for our application to ensure its functionality and correctness. This helps in catching potential errors early in the development process and aids in continuous integration and delivery processes.

### 5. Error Handling:

FastAPI provides built-in error handling which helps in gracefully managing unexpected situations and providing meaningful error messages to the users.

## Testing:

We use Pytest, a popular testing tool for Python, for our application tests. Pytest provides a straightforward way to write simple, scalable test cases.

To set up Pytest:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
  

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute the tests, and pytest will provide a summary of the test results.

By applying these best practices and ensuring thorough testing, we can be confident in the quality and reliability of our web application.
