## Framework

I chose Flask as the framework for developing this web app for several reasons:

- Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach. It doesn't come with a lot of built-in features or components, which makes it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized projects like this one.

- Flask is easy to set up and get started with.

- Flask has a well-documented official documentation and a large community of users and developers. This makes it easy to find answers to questions, troubleshoot issues, and learn about best practices. In a real-world scenario, this would be valuable for long-term maintenance and scalability.

Flask was the best option for this task due to its simplicity, ease of setup, and suitability for small web applications. It allowed me to quickly develop and test the Python web application to display the current time in Moscow, meeting the task requirements efficiently.

## Applied Best Practices

- **PEP 8**: Followed the PEP 8 style guide for code readability and consistency.
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Linters and formatters run every time a change is committed.
- **Environment Management**: Utilized a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
- **Project Structure**: Followed a well-structured project layout.
- **Version Control**: Used Git to track changes in the codebase.
- **Unit Tests**: Created unit tests to check the response code and change of time in each response.
