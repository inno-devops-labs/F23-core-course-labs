# Python description and best practices

## Python Best Practices Applied

1. **Coding Standards**: The Python code adheres to PEP 8 coding style guidelines, ensuring consistency and readability.

1. **Testing**: Unit tests are included in the `tests` directory to validate application functionality using the `pytest` testing framework.

1. **Static Files**: Static files (HTML and JavaScript) are served correctly from the `static` directory, adhering to best practices.

## Framework Choice: FastAPI

### Pros

- **High Performance**: FastAPI is known for its high performance, making it suitable for building efficient web applications.

- **Automatic Documentation**: It automatically generates interactive documentation, simplifying API testing and usage. But I didn't use it in this project.

- **Asynchronous Support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming, allowing for concurrent request handling and improved performance.

- **Routing**: It offers a powerful routing system for defining routes and handling HTTP requests efficiently.

### Cons

- **Small Community**: FastAPI is a relatively new framework, so it has a smaller community compared to other frameworks.

## Linters

- **PEP 8**: Code follows PEP 8 guidelines for Python code formatting and style.

- **pytest**: Unit tests are written and executed using the pytest testing framework to ensure code reliability.

## Unit Test Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Test Names:** Test functions are named to clearly convey what they are testing, enhancing code readability and understanding.

1. **Isolation:** Each test function is isolated, ensuring it doesn't depend on external resources or the state of other tests.

1. **Test Coverage**: Unit tests cover the majority of the code, ensuring that most of the code is tested.

1. **Test Cases**: Test cases are included to test different scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that the code is robust.

1. **Assertions**: Test functions include assertions to validate the code's behavior, ensuring that it works as expected.
