#    # Python Web Application Description
## Application Name:  Moscow Time

## Overview
Purpose: Display the current time in Moscow.

Main features: 
- current time display
- automatic refresh
- responsive design 
- 
## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML, CSS

## Unit Tests

I have implemented a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate the functionality and robustness of my Python code. These tests follow industry best practices to ensure the reliability of application. Here are some key points regarding unit testing approach:

- **Test Framework**: I use the built-in `unittest` framework for writing and running unit tests, providing a structured approach to test case organization.

- **Test Coverage**: Tests aim to achieve high code coverage, ensuring that a significant portion of codebase is thoroughly tested.

- **Test Automation**: Unit tests are seamlessly integrated into CI/CD pipeline, automatically executed on each code change to catch issues early.

- **Isolation and Independence**: Each test case is designed to be independent, avoiding hidden dependencies between tests.

- **Clear Test Names**: I followed a naming convention that makes it easy to understand the purpose of each test case.

- **Mocking**: I used mocking when necessary to isolate code from external dependencies and focus on specific parts of my application.



## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

[![app_python](https://github.com/girllwhocodes/core-course-labs/actions/workflows/app_python-CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/girllwhocodes/core-course-labs/actions/workflows/app_python-CI.yml)


I have set up a CI workflow using GitHub Actions to automate various tasks in my development process. This workflow ensures that code is continuously tested and integrated whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

### Workflow Details

CI workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Linting and Code Formatting**: I used [linter/tool name] to check code for style and formatting issues, ensuring consistency in the codebase.

2. **Unit Tests**: I ran a suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of web application. These tests help catch bugs early and ensure code behaves as expected.

3. **Deployment**: After successful linting and testing, I deployed application to [production/staging/development] servers. This step ensures that application is always up to date with the latest changes.

### Triggering the Workflow

The CI workflow is triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. This ensures that all code changes are tested before being merged into the main codebase.

### Monitoring

Monitor the status of CI workflow in the [Actions tab](../../actions) of this repository. You can find detailed information about each workflow run, including any errors or failures.
