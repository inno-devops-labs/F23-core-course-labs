# Best Practices

- Actions are only triggered when changes occur in the `app_python` folder.
- Cached requirements to speed up installing dependencies.
- Running pre commit linting.
- Snyk is integrated into CI workflow to identify and address vulnerabilities in projects.
- Secrets are used to store sensitive data.
- Added status badge in README.md file to see the status of CI workflow.
