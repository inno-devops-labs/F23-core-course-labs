# CI Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in my GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.

## Stages Division

I follow a modular approach in my workflow by dividing it into different stages:

- **Test Stage**: I use the test stage to run unit tests and code linters. This helps ensure code quality and correctness before proceeding further.

- **Security Scanning with Snyk**: I have incorporated Snyk into my workflow to scan my Python code for security vulnerabilities. This helps me proactively identify and address potential security issues.

- **Docker Build and Push**: I build and push Docker images as part of my CI/CD process. This stage ensures that my application is containerized and can be deployed consistently.

## Build Cache Utilization

In the testing stage of my workflow, I employ caching to speed up the installation of Python packages using `pip`.

## Security Scanning with Snyk

I use the Snyk GitHub Actions integration to scan my Python packages for security vulnerabilities.

## Secrets Usage

I adhere to security best practices by using GitHub Secrets for sensitive information, such as credentials and tokens. Sensitive data, such as Docker Hub credentials (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) and the Snyk token (`SNYK_TOKEN`), are stored as secrets in my GitHub repository.
