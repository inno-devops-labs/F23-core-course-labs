# CI Best Practices

In CI workflow, I've implemented the following best practices to ensure efficiency and reliability:

## Workflow Optimization

- **Parallel Tests**: I've parallelized test suite to reduce execution time.
- **Caching**: I utilized build caching for dependencies to speed up builds.
- **Workflow Triggers**: The workflow is triggered only on pushes to specific branches to minimize unnecessary runs.
- **Docker Optimization**: Docker image builds are optimized for efficiency.
