# Docker Best Practices

## User Privileges

Inside the Dockerfile for this project, I employ the best practice of avoiding unnecessary privileges by creating a dedicated user within the Docker container. This user is used to run the application, enhancing security and reducing potential risks.

## Trusted Base Image

I use a trusted base image as the foundation for my Docker container. The use of official images ensures that I am building on a solid and well-maintained foundation, reducing the risk of using an unreliable base image.

## Exposed Ports

I explicitly expose the necessary ports in my Dockerfile. This makes it clear which ports my application requires for communication.

## Layer Sanity

To optimize the build process and improve Docker image layer management, I prioritize installing the required libraries at the beginning of the Dockerfile. This practice minimizes changes in layers that are less likely to change frequently, resulting in faster and more efficient image builds.
