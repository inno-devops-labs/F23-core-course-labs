# Docker Best Practices

In this document, we discuss the Docker best practices implemented in our Dockerfile to enhance the security and efficiency of our containerized Python web application.

## Non-Root User

We have created a non-root user and configured our container to run as this user. Running applications as non-root users is a best practice to mitigate potential security risks. It reduces the scope of possible attacks and limits the damage that can be caused by potential vulnerabilities.

## Minimizing Image Size

To reduce the attack surface and minimize the size of our Docker image, we have removed unnecessary files and dependencies. A smaller image size not only improves security but also decreases storage and bandwidth requirements, making our application more efficient.

## Updating and Patching

We regularly update and patch our base image and packages to ensure that our container environment is up to date with the latest security patches. Keeping software components current is essential for maintaining a secure Docker image.

## Limiting Privileges

We employ Docker's `--cap-drop` and `--cap-add` options to limit container privileges. This follows the principle of least privilege, allowing our container only the necessary capabilities it needs to function. By restricting privileges, we reduce the potential impact of security vulnerabilities.
