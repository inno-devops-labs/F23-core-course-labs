## Best practices for Dockerfile

1. Use a specific version for the base image. Instead of using the latest version of the base image, it is recommended to use a specific version to ensure consistency.
2. Remove any unnecessary files or dependencies after installation to reduce the size of the final image and minimize security risks.
